To your left is the orphanage. It's been renovated two years ago.\
Your friend projected it.\
Istok.\
And he was only the first year of architecture, too... talent nobody had ever seen before.\
Would he recognize you now, though, dear Alumnus?\
He mostly looks at the bottom of the glass these days.\
Oh well. Artists. They all end up drinking.\
The last you've heard is that he dropped out for good, returned home.\
His building should be somewhere close...\
Want to go say hi?

- ...No, not really
	Maybe you're right. You shouldn't pick at the old wounds.\
After all, the last time you saw each other...\
Did not go that great, did it.\
You didnâ€™t stop being friends; you just started pretending you never were.\
You should go home.
