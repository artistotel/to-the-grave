You look at the clock. 7am.\
Don't think too much about that dream, Alumnus. Dreams don't really mean anything.\
Dreams are like fortune cookiesâ€”fun to crack open, but mostly nonsense.\
You get up.\
Today's a big day. They will announce the murder that's taken place.
if {inventoryitems.knife} == true:
	And you still keep the main piece of evidence.\
Quit it. If your hands shake, it will just make you seem more suspicious.
else:
	Leaving that knife there was smart.

You enter the kitchen.\
The TV is on.\
Here comes the big surprise.
renata_klakochar: The body of mayor Ivanich was found between the park and the bridge today at early hours of the morning.\
Question remains\: who could've done such a horrible thing?\
We are here with Ersad Dibrich. Ersad, could it be politically motivated?
ersad_dibrich: Thank you, Renata. Yes, so far that seems as the most likely reason...\
The elections are less than two months away, after all. But we cannot outrule other motives either...
You look at your parents, glued to the screen.\
Your mother looks awfully shaken. Like her own kin was murdered. Like Ela died.\
Your father scoffs.
bepo_knezevich: Good riddance to him, I say. Fucking cunt.
marija_knezevich: How can you say that?! Have you lost it?!\
Who's going to pay for Ela's treatment now?!!!
Wait.\
Pay for Ela's treatment?
marinknezevich (shocked): What do you mean pay for Ela's treatment?
Your father laughs.
if {walkhome} == "longbarvisit":
	bepo_knezevich: Of course you don't know. No, you're out, sneaking around bars, couldn't even come to visit her last night.
bepo_knezevich: Did you really think the pitiful money you send home pays for all the medication she needs?
marija_knezevich: I... Marin... We didn't want to tell you...\
Matej has been the one funding her treatment for the last year. Ever since her illness worsened.
bepo_knezevich: But no, with the future doctor here, we don't need his charity anymore, do we?
marinknezevich (angry): Now hang on...
[sound volume="0.0"]
marinknezevich (shocked): Who's that?
anja_ivanich: Open up. It's Anja.
Matej's daughter.\
She also works for the police.
if {inventoryitems.knife} == true:
	And you still have that knife.
	- Hide it!
		But where? You look a bit around.\
Ela's room is the safest option.
		- I can't...
			We will figure something else out later. We are out of time now.
		- They won't look there...
			Awful, awful.
			set {knifeelasroom} = true
			set {guilt} += 1
			[signal arg="guilt_increased"]
			You'd do that to your sister? Well, nevermind, you just lightly open the door, and while nobody is looking, throw the knife behind the closet...\
She seems to be asleep.
	- No time!
		set {knifewithyou} = true
marija_knezevich: Coming!
She lets Anja in.\
Her face is like made of stone. If there were any tears, they seem to have dried long time ago.\
Your mother still pulls her into a hug.\
She's a kind woman like that.
marija_knezevich: Oh, Anja, I'm so sorry about your father... We've just heard it on the news...
anja_ivanich (ugh): ...\
Thank you, ma'am Knezevich. I'm here by duty, though. Mind if I ask you a few questions?\
...
anja_ivanich (def): ...?\
Marin? You're here? When did you come?
if {walkhome} == "longbarvisit":
	bepo_knezevich: This morning, around 4am. He had to make a stop at the bar, you see.
else:
	marija_knezevich: Last night... he's been here the entire night, just ask Ela...
Anja takes a few notes. You awkwardly smile.
anja_ivanich: The murder took place, according to our forensics, last night around 9pm... When exactly did you come home?
- ...Before
	anja_ivanich: By the train? I thought it was running late. As trains here usually do...\
Hm.
	marinknezevich (laugh): Right... my fault... must've been later then.
- ...After
anja_ivanich (ugh): Alright. From the train station to here you had to go over... either the park or the bridge.\
Did you see anything suspicious?
- I took the longer route, over the factory.
	set {lies} = "factory"
	set {lie} += 1
	She notes that down.
	anja_ivanich: So, you didn't see anything... alright. If you remember anything, give me a call.
- I didn't see anything.
	anja_ivanich (def): Are you sure?
	- I'm sure.
		anja_ivanich: Alright, well... if you remember anything, give me a call, fine?
	- Actually...
		Be careful, Alumnus. Don't you remember our little rule?\
Do you really want this game to end so soon?
		- I've seen nothing.
			anja_ivanich: Alright, well... if you remember anything, give me a call, fine?
		- I've seen something.
			...It's not very nice to agree to play a game and then disrespect its rules.\
But, well. Your choice is yours only.\
You relay upon Anja everything you've seen that night.\
The girl, the knife, the puddle of blood... you know who's murdered her father.\
Tch tch tch. Tattletale.
			jump demo_end/
anja_ivanich: Alright, well... I need to get going...
marija_knezevich: Do you want to stay for a drink...? This must be so hard for you, Anja...
anja_ivanich (ugh): I'm fine. Seriously.\
Glad to see you, Marin.
marinknezevich (default): It was nice to see you too.
anja_ivanich (def): The funeral is tomorrow. I know... that he'd like if you were there. All of you.
Well, except your father. You can see it in her eyes.
marija_knezevich: We'll be there. Won't we, Marin?
- Um...
- Sure...
marija_knezevich: We'll see you. Anja, take time off... don't... overwork yourself.
anja_ivanich: I'll be calmer looking for the murderer than sitting at home, I assure you, ma'am Knezevich.\
Marin... call me up for a drink, when you're free.
That woman is like made of a stone.\
Regardless, she leaves...
if {inventoryitems.knife} == true:
	You're safe for now. That knife...
	if {knifeelasroom} == true:
		And to think you've hid it in Ela's room...
else:
	You're safe for now.\
Hey, do you wonder what would've happened if you had taken that knife with you?\
There's another Marin Knezevich, in different timeline... and he probably isn't having that much of a good time now.
ela_knezevich (shocked): Who was that?
marija_knezevich: Oh, love...
She relays the news of the murder upon her. Ela seems weaker and weaker with every word.
ela_knezevich (pensive): But... who could do such a thing?! I mean... he was a nice man, a kind man, he always gave to the poor...\
He's the one who single-handedly funded the orphanage renovations!
Really... who could've?\
Oh, you know that answer already. The question is... why?\
And why are you protecting that girl?\
Oh, haha. You know the answer to that too.\
Because it's the rule.\
Or maybe... you've already broken it, behind my back.\
In that case you know what happens.\
Still, it still doesn't answer that big looming 'why'.
if {walkhome} == "longbarvisit":
	ela_knezevich (shocked): Marin? When did you get here?
	Oh. Right. You haven't seen her yet.
	marinknezevich (facepalm): Pretty late...
	bepo_knezevich: Or early. As you take it...
	ela_knezevich (default): I'm glad to see you.
	She stayed up the entire night waiting for you. Until sleep took over her.\
And to think how you used to stand at her door, listening to her breathe... making sure she didn't stop.\
But last night, the bar was more attractive option.\
I won't blame you. You did witness a murder, after all.
marinknezevich (default): I need to take a walk. But I'll be back later, okay?
ela_knezevich (pensive): But...
marinknezevich (laugh): It will all be fine.
Enough with the lies.\
Let's go take that walk.\
And maybe chat a bit.\
Just you and me, Alumnus.
