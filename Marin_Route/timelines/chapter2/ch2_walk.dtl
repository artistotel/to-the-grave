The doors close behind you with not even a creak, but a sigh.

In front of your house stands the orange tree, defiant in its mediocrity. Its branches stretch awkwardly, as if reaching for greatness but settling for "good enough."\
It grows a single fruit, lopsided and dimpled, clinging to the branch like it knows itâ€™s the last hope for something meaningful.\
Pick it? Or leave it there, a sad metaphor waiting for its next victim?
- Take it
	set {inventoryitems.orange} = true
	set {despair} -= 1
	[signal arg="despair_decreased"]
	It really blooms so nicely. It's sad, though. That there is only single one.\
But congratulations, you have a single orange now.\
Maybe you can use it to bribe someone. Ha ha ha!\
Or just keep it for now.
- Leave it
	set {guilt} -= 1
	[signal arg="guilt_decreased"]
	Yeah. Leave it for the animals. Bugs. Birds.\
Finches.\
Ferrets.
What should we do now?
[background arg="res://Marin_Route/black2.png" fade="3.0"]
marinknezevich (default): Find the girl, of course.
Sure. She could be anywhere. Maybe she isn't even from this town.\
We can ask around. You still have some time before the funeral.
if {knifewithyou} == true:
	And you still have that knife in your pocket.
elif {knifeelasroom} == true:
	At least you got rid of the knife. Bad news, it's still in Ela's room.\
Let's just hope she doesn't find it.
Where to, chief?
- The place of the murder
	Are you sure...? The place must be crawling with police.
	marinknezevich: Maybe. But maybe there are some clues.
	jump ch2_murderplace/
- The bar
	if {walkhome} == "bar":
		Yeah, but you've already been there. Nothing good came out of it.
		marinknezevich: Someone could know something.
		jump ch2_bar/
- ...
	Oh, you have another idea?
	- ...Istok's place
		if {walkhome} == "istok":
			Really...? But you've been there already. And it wasn't that fun.
		else:
			Hm. Why him?
		marinknezevich (default): I feel... like he has something to do with it.
		Well. Doesn't hurt to pay him a visit, sure...
